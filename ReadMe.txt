General Information
The error "Failed to load class "org.slf4j.impl.StaticLoggerBinder"" is normal.
The reason the program is stuck on this error is because the program is creating a database for the first time.
This process should take at most 30 seconds.
The map will load up automatically after this time.

If you run into the error "No suitable driver for database" remove and add the org.xerial:sqlite-jdbc:3.30.1 dependency again.
Inorder to do this click on File -> Project Structure -> Global Libraries -> org.xerial:sqlite-jdbc:3.30.1 -> Minus.
Then add the dependency as explained above.
